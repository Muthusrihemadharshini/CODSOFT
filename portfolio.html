        <h2>PROJECT 1</h2>
        <li>MOOD GLOW RING</li>
        <h2>MoodGlow Ring
            Description: Developed a wearable smart ring that changes colors based on the user's mood and physiological data. The ring uses sensors to monitor heart rate, skin temperature, and other biometric data to determine the user's emotional state.
           <br>
            Technologies Used: Arduino, Bluetooth, Python, Machine Learning, 3D Printing, CAD Design
           <br>
            Your Role: Conceptualized the idea, designed the hardware and software components, and led the team through the development process. Implemented machine learning algorithms to interpret biometric data and control the ring's color-changing feature.
           <br>
            Achievements/Results: Successfully created a functional prototype, demonstrated the project at a tech exhibition, and received positive feedback for innovation and potential market impact.</h2>

        <h2>PROJECT 2</h2>
        <li>ECO GRID</li>
        <h2>ecogrid</h2>
        Eco Grod
Description: Developed an innovative, eco-friendly irrigation system designed to optimize water usage for agricultural purposes. 
The system uses soil moisture sensors and weather data to determine the optimal watering schedule, reducing water waste and 
promoting sustainable farming practices.
Technologies Used: IoT, Arduino, Python, Machine Learning, Soil Moisture Sensors, Cloud Computing
Your Role: Led the project from concept to exhibition, designed the system architecture, and developed the software algorithms for data analysis and decision-making. Integrated IoT devices with a cloud platform for real-time monitoring and control.
Achievements/Results: Successfully showcased the project at a technology exhibition, receiving positive feedback for its potential in sustainable agriculture. Currently awaiting implementation for real-world testing and application.
